This is the public repository for my personal website. While most files have been moved to a private repository, I'm keeping this as a public reference.

## Inspiration

This website was inspired by several personal blogs:

- [MewX's website](https://www.mewx.org/) - The primary design inspiration, including framework and navigation elements
- [Yuyicheng's blog](https://www.dogfight360.com/blog/) - Home page blog card design

## About the Site

Built using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, this website serves as my personal space for thoughts, film reviews, mathematical explorations, and occasional technical content. The site features a pink-themed design, with custom styling for posts and a table of contents function.

## Technical Details

### Jekyll Plugins

The site uses the following Jekyll plugins:

- jekyll-feed - For generating RSS feeds
- jemoji - For emoji support in posts
- Table of Contents - Using [allejo/jekyll-toc](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc) (included in _includes)

### Markdown

Using Kramdown with Rouge syntax highlighting.

## Repository Status

Most files from this repository have been migrated to a private repository under my GitHub Education account. This public repository will not be regularly updated.
